Not only do we deliver the most comprehensive cloud-based fund raising and management products, but we lower your risk, save you money and offer exciting new ways for organizations to run. Since 2002, Click & Pledge has served over 10,000 customers in 46 countries…and we’re carefully expanding. Good, but not too good to be true.
